    "- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It makes the development and maintenance easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides data hiding through encapsulation.You cannot access private data from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming is the problem-solving approach and used where computation is done by using objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using OOPs multiple instances of an object can be made through polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced high complexity of code, though abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reuse of code, by the child class inheriting properties of parent class through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
